# Jet Engine Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction

#### -- Project Status: Active

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of jet engines using machine learning and deep learning, which will enable operators to adopt a proactive approach to maintenance, reduce costs, maximize asset utilization, enhance safety, optimize performance, and make data-driven decisions to ensure the reliable and efficient operation of their aircraft fleet.

## Project Description

Aircraft engine maintenance strategies typically fall into several categories:

1. Scheduled Maintenance: This involves routine inspections and servicing of engine components according to predefined schedules recommended by the engine manufacturer or aviation authorities. Scheduled maintenance tasks can include oil changes, filter replacements, and visual inspections to ensure components are functioning within specified limits.
2. On-Condition Maintenance: Instead of being based on fixed schedules, on-condition maintenance relies on the actual condition of engine components. Monitoring systems, such as engine health monitoring (EHM) and condition monitoring systems (CMS), continuously collect data on engine parameters and performance. Maintenance actions are then triggered based on predetermined thresholds or trends indicating degradation or impending failure.
3. Preventive Maintenance: Preventive maintenance involves preemptive actions taken to prevent failures or degradation of engine components. This can include tasks such as component replacements, overhauls, or adjustments performed at regular intervals to mitigate the risk of failures occurring during operation.
4. Condition-Based Maintenance: Condition-based maintenance combines elements of both scheduled and on-condition maintenance approaches. Maintenance actions are scheduled based on the condition of engine components, as determined by real-time monitoring and analysis of sensor data. This allows for a more dynamic and adaptive maintenance strategy that responds to the actual operating conditions and health of the engine.
5. Proactive Maintenance: Proactive maintenance aims to address potential issues before they escalate into significant problems. This can involve predictive techniques, proactive component replacements based on historical performance data, and implementing design changes or upgrades to improve reliability and performance.
In this context, traditional maintenance of jet engines can be challenging for several reasons:

1. Complexity: Jet engines are intricate pieces of machinery with thousands of components, including rotating parts, compressors, turbines, and intricate fuel systems. Keeping track of all these components and ensuring they work together efficiently requires specialized knowledge and expertise.
2. High Performance Standards: Jet engines must operate at high speeds and under extreme conditions, such as high temperatures and pressures. Maintaining these engines to meet the demanding performance standards while ensuring safety and reliability is a complex task.
3. Safety Concerns: The consequences of engine failure in an aircraft can be catastrophic. Therefore, maintenance procedures must be thorough and rigorous to identify and address any potential issues before they compromise safety.
4. Accessibility: Accessing certain parts of a jet engine, especially those deep within the engine core, can be challenging. Specialized equipment and procedures are often required to perform maintenance tasks effectively.
5. Cost: Jet engine maintenance can be expensive, especially for commercial airlines operating large fleets of aircraft. Balancing the need to keep costs down with the imperative to maintain safety and reliability requires careful planning and management.
6. Downtime Impact: Aircraft are only profitable when they are flying, so minimizing downtime for maintenance is crucial for airlines. This requires efficient scheduling and coordination of maintenance activities to minimize disruption to flight schedules.

Maintenance is too costly and time consuming but needs to be done routinely; hence, i costs a fortune to maintain and check them for any type of damage propagation due mechanical tear. To reduce this cost of maintenance, we have designed a robust machine learning solution by calculating Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of jet engines based on various sensor data obtained from engines.
